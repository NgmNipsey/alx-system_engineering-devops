## What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter

When you type https://www.google.com into your browser and press Enter, a complex series of events occur behind the scenes to bring Google's homepage to your screen. This process involves several key components and technologies, including DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. Let's explore each step in detail.

### 1. DNS Request

The first step in accessing a website is resolving its domain name to an IP address. When you enter https://www.google.com, your browser checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address for Google. If not, it initiates a DNS (Domain Name System) request.

1. **Browser Cache**: The browser first looks for a cached DNS entry.
2. **Operating System Cache**: If not found, it queries the OS's DNS cache.
3. **Router Cache**: If still unresolved, the request goes to your router.
4. **ISP DNS Server**: The router forwards the request to your Internet Service Provider's DNS server.
5. **Recursive DNS Servers**: If the ISP's DNS server doesn't have the record, it queries other DNS servers until it finds the authoritative DNS server for google.com.
6. **Authoritative DNS Server**: The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address for www.google.com.

### 2. TCP/IP

With the IP address obtained, your browser establishes a connection to the Google server using the TCP/IP protocol.

1. **TCP Handshake**: A three-step process is used to establish a connection:
   - **SYN**: Your browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the Google server.
   - **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
   - **ACK**: Your browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet, completing the handshake.

### 3. Firewall

During this connection process, firewalls on both your end and Google's end play a crucial role in security.

1. **Client Firewall**: Ensures outgoing requests are legitimate and blocks unauthorized access.
2. **Server Firewall**: Protects Google's servers by filtering incoming traffic to block malicious requests.

### 4. HTTPS/SSL

To ensure data privacy and security, the connection uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).

1. **SSL/TLS Handshake**: An SSL/TLS handshake occurs to establish an encrypted connection:
   - **Certificate Exchange**: The Google server sends its SSL certificate to your browser.
   - **Certificate Verification**: Your browser verifies the certificate's authenticity.
   - **Session Keys**: Both parties generate session keys for encryption.

### 5. Load Balancer

Once the secure connection is established, the request may pass through a load balancer.

1. **Load Distribution**: Google's load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed, optimizing resource use and maintaining high availability.

### 6. Web Server

The load balancer forwards the request to a web server.

1. **Request Handling**: The web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) processes the request and determines how to handle it. For static content, the web server can directly respond with the requested resource.

### 7. Application Server

For dynamic content, the web server forwards the request to an application server.

1. **Dynamic Processing**: The application server (e.g., Google’s custom application server) runs the necessary backend logic, interacts with databases, and generates the HTML content for the response.

### 8. Database

If the requested content requires data retrieval, the application server queries the database.

1. **Database Query**: The application server sends a query to the database server (e.g., Google’s Bigtable, Spanner).
2. **Data Retrieval**: The database processes the query and returns the requested data to the application server.
3. **Data Processing**: The application server processes the data, integrates it into the web page, and sends it back to the web server.

### 9. Response to Browser

Finally, the web server sends the generated HTML content back to your browser through the established TCP/IP connection.

1. **Rendering**: Your browser receives the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and renders the web page.
2. **Additional Requests**: The browser may make additional requests for assets like images, stylesheets, and scripts, which follow a similar process.

### Conclusion

This entire process, from typing a URL to seeing a web page, happens in milliseconds. It involves numerous components working seamlessly together, ensuring a secure, fast, and reliable web experience. Understanding these steps highlights the complexity and sophistication of modern web technologies.

This diagram captures the main components and flow of the request, showing how the DNS resolution, secure connection, and load balancing work together to deliver the requested web page. The sequence includes:

1. **DNS Resolution**: Resolves the domain to an IP address.
2. **TCP/IP Handshake**: Establishes a connection with the Google server.
3. **Firewall**: Traffic passes through client and server firewalls.
4. **HTTPS/SSL**: Ensures traffic is encrypted.
5. **Load Balancer**: Distributes the request across multiple servers.
6. **Web Server**: Handles the request and forwards it if necessary.
7. **Application Server**: Processes the request and interacts with the database.
8. **Database**: Retrieves the necessary data.
9. **Response to Browser**: Sends the generated web page back to the browser.

This entire process ensures that your request is handled efficiently and securely.
